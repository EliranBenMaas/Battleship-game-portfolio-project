This is a simple text-based implementation of the classic Battleship game. The game board is a 10x10 grid where players can guess coordinates to try to sink the opponent's ships. The game tracks hits and misses, and the first player to sink all of the opponent's ships wins.

How to Play
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Run the battleship.py file in a Python environment.
Follow the on-screen instructions to enter your guesses and try to sink the opponent's ships.
